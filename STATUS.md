We request the Available and Reusable badges. After carefully reading the guidelines for [artifact submissions](https://conf.researchr.org/getImage/icse-2023/orig/fse_artifacts_submission_reviewing_guidelines.pdf), 
we confirmed that our artifact meets the requirements for the two badges.

* __Available__
Our artifact is "Available" as we provide it via two publicly accessible archival repositories:
- Github: <https://github.com/kupl/Diver-Artifact>
- Zenodo: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7632205>

* __Reusable__ 
Our artifact is "Reusable" as we meet the following five criteria, where the first four are the criteria for "Functional" badge.
- _Documented_: We satisfy this criterion as we provide sufficient descriptions to use our artifact in the Github repository above. In particular, as specified in call for artifact submissions,2 we provide the following documents through the Github repository (also available in the Zenodo): (1) README, (2) REQUIREMENTS, (3) STATUS, (4) LICENSE, (5) INSTALL, and (6) a copy of the accepted paper.
- _Consistent & Complete_: We satisfy these two criteria as we provide concrete steps for reproducing all experimental results.
- _Exercisable_: We satisfy this crietrion as we provide scripts and related commands for reproducing experimental results.
- _Reusable for Future Researches_: We satisfy this criterion as we provide detailed instructions on how to run Diver on new other benchmarks, so that other researchers can use Diver in their own researches.
